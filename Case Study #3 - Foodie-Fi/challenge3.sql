-- A. Customer Journey
-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

-- Answer for A
-- From 8 customers, 6 of them are continuing their subscription plan and only 2 customers who decided to stop any subscription.
